==============================================
 SuperGenPass Python module and GTK interface
==============================================

This project is a Python 3.x implementation of the SuperGenPass_ bookmarklet.
It provides a module to be used in other programs, a command-line interface and
a GTK 3 interface.

.. _SuperGenPass: http://www.supergenpass.com/


Installation
=============

Setup is handled by ``distutils``. To install the module and interface, do::

    python setup.py install

The module and the CLI do not require any extra module. The GTK interface
requires GTK+ 3 and PyGObject_.

.. _PyGObject: https://live.gnome.org/PyGObject


Usage
======

As a Python module
-------------------

The module is named ``supergenpass``. The two main methods are:

* ``generate(master, domain)``: derive a SuperGenPass password,
* ``strip_domain(domain)``: strip a domain name/URL to its base domain name.

Use Python's ``help`` function for more information.


As a standalone program
------------------------

You can launch the CLI using ``supergenpass`` in your shell. Use with ``-h``
to get the full list of accepted arguments.

To launch the GTK interface, use ``supergenpass -g``. The domain textbox will
be populated with the clipboard's content if a URL or domain name is
recognized. The derived password will be copied to the clipboard when clicking
on the OK button. If the password is still in the clipboard after 2 minutes,
it will be cleared.

The default options may be altered in ``~/.config/supergenpass.ini`` (for
user-specific configuration) or ``/etc/supergenpass.ini`` (for system-wide
configuration). See ``supergenpass -h`` for more information.
